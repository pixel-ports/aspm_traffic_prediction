# ASPM Short-term traffic volume predictions
The git repository contains Jupyter Notebooks used for short term traffic volume prediction on the regional roads around the Port of Monfalcone. The source of traffic data is the SILI (Sistema Informativo Logistico Integrato) system. The data was acquired from 11 locations in the Friuli Venezia Giulia region from March 2015 to August 2019. In total it consists of 95 million records of vehicles passing the gates. The repository is assembled from three parts. The first part is used for data pre-processing, the second part for exploratory data analysis and the third part is used for building the models and their evaluations. We used and evaluated two different machine learning algorithms. The first one is Facebook Prophet. It is a python library used for time series machine learning tasks. The second one is XGBoost. It is also a python library, which utilizes gradient boosting techniques. For this algorithm, we had to transform our problem from the time series into relational.
